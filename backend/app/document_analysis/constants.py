"""Configuration for the document analysis module.

Centralizes the analysed document types, the verification statuses, the scoring
weights and thresholds, and the analysis version. The extractor, validator,
consistency and scoring code consume these constants, so tuning a threshold or
adding a document type never requires touching the service or route layers.
