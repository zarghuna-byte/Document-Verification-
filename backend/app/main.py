"""FastAPI application entry point.

Defines the application factory ``create_app`` and a module-level ``app``
instance used by the ASGI server (``uvicorn app.main:app``). The factory keeps
application construction explicit and makes it trivial to build configured app
instances for tests and command-line tooling.
