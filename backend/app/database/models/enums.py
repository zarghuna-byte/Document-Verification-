"""Domain enums shared by the ORM models.

Each enum maps to a native PostgreSQL ``ENUM`` type via SQLAlchemy. Native enum
types enforce allowed values at the database level (data integrity) while the
Python ``Enum`` classes keep the values strongly typed in application code. The
enum type name derives from the class name in lower case; when a new value is
added to an enum that already exists in a production database, a dedicated
migration must ``ALTER TYPE`` the enum.
