"""Pydantic models forming the final human verification API contract.

The review screen carries everything the employee needs to make the final
decision -- the aggregated validation report, the uploaded documents, the
normalized and confidence-scored extracted fields, the visual detection results
and the current checklist state -- while the review request carries the
decision, the checklist completion, the optional corrections and the mandatory
rejection reason for rejections.
