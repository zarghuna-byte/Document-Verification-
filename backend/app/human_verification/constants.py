"""Configuration for the final human verification module.

Centralizes the module version, the mandatory manual-review checklist, the
decision-to-status mapping and the audit action identifiers. This phase only
records the employee's review and decision -- it never runs OCR, normalization,
rule validation or report generation -- so the constants here are the fixed
vocabulary the rest of the module shares.

#: Version of the human review logic. Bumped whenever the decision rules, the
#: checklist or the audit vocabulary changes so a stored review can be traced
#: to the exact logic that produced it.
