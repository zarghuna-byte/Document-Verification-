Centralizes the evaluation statuses, the per-field verification statuses, the
critical-field classification, the confidence source identifiers and the audit
action names. The threshold and the source weights themselves live in
``app.core.config.Settings`` so they can be tuned without touching code; this
module only pins the vocabulary the rest of the module shares.
