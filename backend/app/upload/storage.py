"""Filesystem storage backend for uploaded documents.

Files are kept outside the source tree, under ``storage/applications/APP-xxxxxx/
<document-type-slug>/``. Internal filenames are random UUIDs so the client-supplied
name never reaches the disk; the original name is persisted separately in the
database. All reads/writes go through :class:`StorageService`, which guarantees
every resolved path stays inside the configured storage root (path-traversal
proof) and writes atomically via a temporary file + rename so a crash never
leaves a partially written document behind.
