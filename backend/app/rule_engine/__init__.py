"""Business rule engine package.

Validates an application's normalized, verified evidence against a
deterministic, explainable ruleset. The rules consume only the canonical values
produced by the normalization module (``normalized_value``) plus the stored
visual detection outcomes, and persist one validation result row per executed
rule into the shared validation results table.
