"""Configuration for the business rule engine module.

Centralizes the rule categories, the overall status vocabulary, the severity
mapping, the audit action and the application-level configuration sets the
rules evaluate against. Rules are deliberately driven by data in this module:
changing a required document type, a threshold or a tolerated deviation never
requires touching a rule implementation.

The module ships a complete, deterministic ruleset (``RULE_CATEGORIES``) that
extends the Phase 4 completeness classification with the Phase 10 business
rule requirements. Where the two differ -- the rule engine treats the bilateral
agreement as required -- the rule-engine configuration wins for this module and
the difference is documented in ``docs/rule_engine.md``.
