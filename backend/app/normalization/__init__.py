"""Data normalization module.

Produces a deterministic canonical form for every verified extracted field of an
application and persists it as the field's normalized value, so downstream
business validation compares like-for-like values. The module is deliberately
independent of the document analysis and confidence modules: it only reads the
persisted extracted fields and never re-runs extraction or scoring.
