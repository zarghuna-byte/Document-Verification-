"""Continuous learning module.

Prepares the verified feedback recorded during document verification as a
clean, versioned, machine-learning-ready dataset. The module performs no
validation, OCR, normalization or human review of its own and contains no
training logic: it reads the field-level samples recorded by the confidence
scoring and final human verification phases, excludes incomplete or invalid
records, produces a deterministic SHA-256 digest, computes reproducible
statistics and exports the dataset as JSON or CSV for future OCR, extraction
and document-AI improvements.
