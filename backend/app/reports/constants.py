"""Configuration for the validation report module.

Centralizes the report version, the report-level overall status vocabulary and
its precedence, the mapping from stored validation categories onto the report's
business-rule groups and the deterministic recommendation table. The module
only aggregates what earlier stages persisted -- it never runs any rule or
detection -- so the constants here are pure presentation and derivation data.

The eight report groups are a reorganization of the eight Phase 10 rule
categories: ``field_presence`` folds into ``document_completeness`` and the
``visual`` category splits by rule id prefix into signature and stamp groups.
