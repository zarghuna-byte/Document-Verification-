"""Pydantic models forming the validation report API contract.

The report is a read-only aggregation of data persisted by earlier pipeline
modules. These models mirror that aggregation -- application information,
per-document summary, extraction totals, business rule totals per group, the
visual detection summary and the deterministic recommendations -- without
binding to the ORM, keeping the API contract independent of persistence.
